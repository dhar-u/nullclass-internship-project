Hi there! 👋  
This repository contains all the completed tasks for my internship at **NullClass** (July–August 2025). As part of this internship, I worked on building an intelligent chatbot with advanced features like analytics, dynamic learning, and multilingual support.

## 📌 Project Overview

The internship was divided into 3 core tasks:

---

A Flask-based chatbot that not only responds to users but also tracks useful analytics.

**Features:**
- Tracks total messages and active users
- Logs most asked questions
- Displays most active users
- Clean web UI using HTML + CSS

### 🔹 Task 2: Dynamic Knowledge Base Expansion

**What I built:**  
Made the chatbot smarter by letting it **learn from users** in real-time!

**Features:**
- Users can add new questions and answers
- Knowledge base is stored and updated in JSON
- Bot continues to learn and grow over time

📁 Folder: `task2_dynamic_knowledge_base`

**What I built:**  
A chatbot that speaks your language! 🌍

**Features:**
